I chose Option 1: **Types of Things**.

Here I have assigned a thing to different types, and a type to different things (a many-to-many relationship).

Go to the **Types** tab under **Go To** dropdown.

Choosing any of the types in the upper window should automatically restrict things that display in the lower window to the ones for that specific type and clear the map.

Clicking a thing will display a marker on the map that represents the location of that thing.

Clicking the marker will further display an image and information for that thing.

Note: the `geolocation` and `geocoder` features presented in the lectures still work in the **Types** page, although the origin location will not show in the map per assignment requirements.
